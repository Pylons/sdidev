    <h1>Substance D management interface demo</h1>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/Pylons/substanced">Substance D</a> is an
    application development environment built using the <a
    href="http://pylonsproject.org">Pyramid</a> web framework.  It owes much
    of its spirit to the <a href="http://www.zope.org">Zope 2</a> web
    application server. It has the following features:
    <ul>
      <li>Uses <a href="http://zodb.org">ZODB</a> to store its content</li>
      <li>Has built in users and groups management</li>
      <li>Has a management interface that allows you to edit and add content
          (aka an "admin" interface)</li>
      <li>Has features which allow you to define your own content types for
          management and arbitrary application development purposes</li>
      <li>Allows the application of object-level (aka "row-level") security to content objects.</li>
      <li>Has built-in indexing and searching facilities</li>
      <li>Has machinery for forming relationships between content objects</li>
    </ul>
    To see it in action, click the button below and log in as <b>admin</b> with
    the password <b>admin</b>.

	The two hemispheres of my brain are competing?" Fred said.
    </p>

    <p>
	"Yes."
    </p>

    <p>
	"Why?"
    </p>

    <p>
	"Substance D. It often causes that, functionally. This is what we
	expected; this is what the tests confirm. Damage having taken place in
	the normally dominant left hemisphere, the right hemisphere is attempting
	to compensate for the impairment. But the twin functions do not fuse,
	because this is an abnormal condition the body isn't prepared for. It
	should never happen. "Cross-cuing", we call it. Related to splitbrain
	phenomena. We could perform a right hemispherectomy, but--"
    </p>

    <p>
	"Will this go away," Fred interrupted, "when I get off Substance D?"
    </p>

    <p>
	"Probably," the psychologist on the left said, nodding. "It's a
	functional impairment."
    </p>

    <p>
	The other man said, "It may be organic damage. It may be
	permanent. Time'll tell, and only after you are off Substance D for a
	long while. And off entirely."
    </p>

    <p>
	"What?" Fred said. He did not understand the answer-- was it yes or no?
	Was he damaged forever or not? Which had they said?
